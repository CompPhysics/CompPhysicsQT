===== Possible paths =====

!bblock Alternative 1

o Keep present study direction under the Physics and Astronomy (PA) BSc program called
  * _Quantum technology_, but increase number of students
o Similarly, keep existing study direction under the Physics master of Science program
  * _Quantum Science and Quantum Technology_, but increase number of students
o And do the same for the CS program with the study direction
  * _Quantum Information Science and Technology_, but increase number of students

===== Second alternative  =====

!bblock Alternative 2
o Keep present study direction under the Physics and Astronomy (PA) BSc program called
  * _Quantum technology_, but increase number of students
o Create a new master of science program called
  * _Quantum Science and Technology_ (or something similar)
This will have as a consequence that one may eventually drop the study directions in the CS and Physics MSc programs (see below).

===== Third  alternative  =====

!bblock Alternative 3
o New bachelor program 
  * _Quantum Science and Technology_ (or something similar)
o Create a new master of science program called
  * _Quantum Science and Technology_ (or something similar)
This will have as a consequence that one may eventually drop the study directions in the CS and Physics MSc programs (see below).

===== New master of science program =====

_Quantum Science and Technology_, as a multidisciplinary endeavor (much along the same lines as the CS program)
!bblock Collaboration with four possible departments 
 * Department of Chemistry (quantum chemistry and Hyllerås center, Simen Kvaal and Thomas B. Pedersen, plus several PDs and PhDs)
 * Department of Informatics (cryptography, cyber security, Audun Jøsang)
 * Department of Mathematics (quantum information theory, operator algebra group, Alexander Muller-Hermes, Nadia S. Larsen, Eric Bedos and Sergiy Neshveyev plus several PhDs and PDs)
 * Department of Physics (theory and experiment, several professors, PDs and PhDs, largest activity )

===== Core mission of the program  =====

The master program provides advanced knowledge to develop
cutting-edge theoretical and experimental research in quantum
simulation, quantum computing, quantum sensors, quantum communications
and purely formal theoretical aspects.

Various universities, research centres and companies may actively
participate in teaching the master's degree.
