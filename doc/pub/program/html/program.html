<div class="alert alert-block alert-block alert-text-normal">

<p>
<p>Computational physics, computational science and data science play a
central role in scientific investigations and are central to
innovation in most domains of our lives. These fields underpin the
majority of today's technological, economic and societal feats. We
have entered an era in which huge amounts of data offer enormous
opportunities, but only to those who are able to harness them. The 3rd
industrial revolution will alter significantly the demands on the
workforce. In particular, the developments taking place in quantum
technologies and quantum information systems (QIS) together with
artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) are expected to
play a significant role in technology developments and innovations,
and for fundamental discoveries in physics.

experimental data processing, hold great promise for enhancing
scientific discoveries in many different disciplines.  These
developments cover a broad mix of rapidly evolving fields, from the
development of ML techniques to computer and hardware architectures.

<p>
<p>For our research in for example particle and nuclear physics, fields
which cover a huge range of energy and length scales, spanning from
our smallest constituents to the physics of dense astronomical objects
like supernovae and neutron stars, AI and ML techniques offer
possibilities for new discoveries and deeper insights about the
physics of atomic nuclei, elementary particles and dense
matter. Similarly, ML algorithms are widely applied in condensed
matter physics, materials science and nanotechnology, in molecular
dynamics simulations of complex systems in neuroscience and in many
other fields in natural science.

<h2 id="quantum-information-technologies-qit">Quantum Information Technologies (QIT) </h2>

<div class="alert alert-block alert-block alert-text-normal">
<b></b>
<p>
<p>Recent developments in quantum information systems
and technologies offer the possibility to address some of the most
challenging large-scale problems, whether they are represented by
complicated interacting quantum mechanical systems or classical
systems.  Originally proposed by Feynman, the efficient simulation of
for example quantum systems by other, more controllable quantum
systems formed the basis for modern constructions of quantum
computations.  Many algorithmic and theoretical advances have followed
since the initial work in this area and with recent developments in
quantum computing hardware there is an additional drive to identify
early practical problems on which these devices might demonstrate an
advantage.

<div class="alert alert-block alert-block alert-text-normal">
<b></b>
<p>
<p>In addition to theoretical activities conducted at the Department of
Physics (mainly at the Center for Computing in Science Education
(CCSE) and the condensed matter group and other groups), there is a
growing interest to study candidate systems for making quantum
hardware. In particular, so-called point defects in semiconductors are
pursued by experimenters at the center for Materials Science.  With
this broad list of activities at the department of physics, there is a
huge potential to prepare the ground for educating physicists with the
theoretical and experimental background needed for the 21st
century. There is also a great interest in candidates with such a
background, knowledge, skills and competences in industry and the
public sector.

<h2 id="why-such-a-change">Why such a change? </h2>

<div class="alert alert-block alert-block alert-text-normal">
<b></b>
<p>
<p>Establishing such educational directions will be unique in Norway and
has the potential to attract excellent students.  The popularity of
the Computational Science and in particular the Computational Physics
and Computational Materials Science study direction are clear
indicators that these are fields with the potential to attract new
students.
</p>
</div>


<div class="alert alert-block alert-block alert-text-normal">
<b></b>
<p>
<p>Oslo Metropolitan university has recently acquired two quantum
quantum computers and is now establishing research and educational
initiatives in quantum information systems. There are thus several
interesting avenues for joint collaborations in quantum information
systems and quantum technologies as well as developing joint
educational programs.
</p>

<h2 id="more-on-motivation">More on motivation </h2>

<p>Computational physics plays a central role in the above mentioned
developments.  Computations are simply indispensable.  At the
department of physics of the university of Oslo this is reflected in
the extremely popular study direction Computational Physics of the
master of science (MSc) program Computational Science. This program
has over the last two decades recruited many excellent students,
resulting in highly attractive candidates in academia and in industry
and the public sector. A large fraction of these students have
specialized either in artificial intelligence and machine learning
and/or in quantum information systems.  The large majority of the
these students have job offers at least one year before completing
their MSc theses. The program has also become one of the most
selective master programs at the University of Oslo, requiring a grade
average of 4.7 for entry in 2021. Furthermore, with recent advances in
quantum technologies, there is a strong potential for new developments
in the fields of nanotechnology and materials science, with the
possibilities to develop new experimental activities.

<h2 id="rationale">Rationale  </h2>

<div class="alert alert-block alert-block alert-text-normal">
<b></b>
<p>
<p>The rationale behind proposing such new study directions is:</p>
<ol>
<li> To attract at an earlier stage new students with an explicit interest in QIS, QT and AI and ML in physics.</li> 
<li> To enhance the recruitment to fields in physics which are in high demand for students and candidates with an expertise in computations, QIS, QT, AI and ML. We expect high demands from both the private sector and the public sector for candidates with these competences, insights and skills.</li>
<li> Candidates with such a background will be of great importance for new scientific discoveries and technological innovations. At the department of physics of the university of Oslo there are several research directions whose scientific activities will benefit at large from candidates with such a background, spanning from fast ML for new discoveries to the development of QTs.</li>   
</ol>

<h2 id="societal-needs">Societal needs </h2>

<div class="alert alert-block alert-block alert-text-normal">
<b></b>
<p>
<p>The new study direction aims at addressing future societal needs, such as the  needs for specialized candidates (Master of Science, PhDs, postdocs), but also the needs of  people with a broad overview of what is possible in  QIS and QT. There are  not enough potential employees in AI, ML, QIS and QT. There is  a clear supply gap.</p>
</div>


<div class="alert alert-block alert-block alert-text-normal">
<b></b>
<p>
<p>A BSc degree  with specialization  is thus a good place to start. Linking this with the Physics MSc  program and the Computational Science program and the study directions Computational physics and Computational materials science, will offer to our various research fields top candidates as well as pointing to new research directions. </p>
