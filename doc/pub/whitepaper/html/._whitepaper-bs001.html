<h2 id="more-on-motivation" class="anchor">More on motivation </h2>

<p>Computational physics plays a central role in the above mentioned
developments.  Computations are simply indispensable.  At the
department of physics of the university of Oslo this is reflected in
the extremely popular study direction Computational Physics of the
master of science (MSc) program Computational Science. This program
has over the last two decades recruited many excellent students,
resulting in highly attractive candidates in academia and in industry
and the public sector. A large fraction of these students have
specialized either in artificial intelligence and machine learning
and/or in quantum information systems.  The large majority of the
these students have job offers at least one year before completing
their MSc theses. The program has also become one of the most
selective master programs at the University of Oslo, requiring a grade
average of 4.7 for entry in 2021. Furthermore, with recent advances in
quantum technologies, there is a strong potential for new developments
in the fields of nanotechnology and materials science, with the
possibilities to develop new experimental activities.
</p>
<h2 id="rationale" class="anchor">Rationale  </h2>

<p>The rationale behind proposing a new bachelor of science (BSc) program in computational physics and quantum technologies (QT) is:</p>
<ol>
<li> To attract at an earlier stage new students with an explicit interest in QIS, QT and AI and ML in physics.</li> 
<li> To enhance the recruitment to fields in physics which are in high demand for students and candidates with an expertise in computations, QIS, QT, AI and ML. We expect high demands from both the private sector and the public sector for candidates with these competences, insights and skills.</li>
<li> Candidates with such a background will be of great importance for new scientific discoveries and technological innovations. At the department of physics of the university of Oslo there are several research directions whose scientific activities will benefit at large from candidates with such a background, spanning from fast ML for new discoveries to the development of QTs.</li>   
</ol>
<h2 id="structure-of-program-and-courses" class="anchor">Structure of Program and Courses </h2>

<p>In developing such a program the Center for Computing in Science
Education (CCSE) at the university of Oslo (UiO) could be the entity
which provides the pedagogical research resources. It has the needed
research experience on how to design curricula so that students
develop deep knowledge that is connected and useful.
</p>

<p>The figure here, inspired by the QuSTEAM project in the USA <a href="https://qusteam.org" target="_self"><tt>https://qusteam.org</tt></a>
shows how one can link educational developments by involving various stakeholders from academia, industry research  laboratories. 
</p>

<br/><br/>
<center>
<p><img src="qusteam.png" width="700" align="bottom"></p>
</center>
<br/><br/>

<p>The reason why we believe the CCSE should be involved in planning this BSc program is that it has the necessary expertise to address several issues, such as</p>

<ol>
<li> Lots of conceptual learning: superposition, entanglement, QIS and QT, etc.</li> 
<li> Connecting statistics and mathematics with ML methods</li>
<li> Linking ML algorithms with quantum ML.</li>
<li> Coding is indispensable. This is a central reason why the CCSE should be involved.</li>
<li> Experience with teamwork, project management, and communication are important and highly valued.</li>
<li> Experience with engagement with industry, public sector and priority to diversity through the Computational Science program and other activities at the CCSE.</li>
<li> Mentorship should begin the moment students enroll. The experiences with the Computational Science program developed at the CCSE will be of great value, as the activities of the KURT center.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="societal-needs" class="anchor">Societal needs </h2>

<p>The program aims at addressing future societal needs, such as the
needs for specialized candidates (Master of Science, PhDs, postdocs),
but also the needs of people with a broad overview of what is possible
in QIS and QT. There are not enough potential employees in AI, ML, QIS
and QT. There is a clear supply gap.
</p>

<p>A BSc degree with specialization is thus a good place to
start. Linking this with the Physics MSc program and the Computational
Science program and the study directions Computational physics and
Computational materials science, will offer our various research
fields top candidates as well as pointing to new research directions.
</p>
<h2 id="study-specializations-in-the-bsc-program" class="anchor">Study specializations in the BSc program </h2>

<p>The program could offer  three possible directions</p>
<ol>
<li> Quantum information systems and quantum technologies</li>
<li> Artificial intelligence and machine learning in physics</li>
<li> Computational Physics</li>
</ol>
<p>The students specialize in these directions in their last year of the BSc program.</p>

<p>There are several existing courses which can be included in this
program. There are also courses which need to be established. At the
CCSE we have the research and educational expertise to establish two
to three new courses in these directions. Most likely there are
potential teachers from other groups.
</p>

<p>A separate application for establishing these courses follows. The
additional courses we propose are (these are suggestions and codes are
tentative) listed here. Note that we propose these courses as cloned
courses. We may consider extensions of these codes in order to offer
PhD variants as well.
</p>

<p>The list here is tentative. Two of the courses, FYS4446 and FYS4447 have been taught as special topics since 2018 and we have already a large body of material.
This list is a mere suggestion.
</p>

<ol>
<li> Classical and quantum laboratory, needs to be established, perhaps by researchers at the Center of Materials Science (LENS group), FYS2440</li>
<li> Quantum computing and software, needs to be established. This can be organized together with OsloMet and Simula Research lab.</li>
<li> Quantum hardware, needs to be established, this can be organized together with OsloMet and Simula Research lab.</li> 
<li> Quantum computing and quantum machine learning, FYS3446/FYS4446 (cloned course, already developed by CCSE)</li>
<li> Advanced machine learning and data analysis for the physical sciences, FYS3447/FYS4447 (already developed by CCSE)</li>
</ol>
<p>The last three courses are elective ones for the last semester of
study. Some of these courses can also be split into modules a 5 ECTS
or 7.5 ECTS.  There are obviously other course alternatives.  The
first year is identical with the BSc program <b>Physics and Astronomy</b>.
</p>

<p>The table here is an example of a suggested path for a Master of Science project,
with course work the first year and thesis work the last year.

<h2 id="description-of-study-directions" class="anchor">Description of Study directions </h2>

<p>The basic structure of the study directions could be</p>

<ul>
<li> Description of study directions with potential projects</li>
<li> Admission criteria</li>
<li> Learning outcomes</li>
<li> Program structure</li>
<li> Semester abroad</li>
<li> Career prospects</li>
<li> Teaching and examinations</li>
</ul>
<p>What follows are text proposals for these items.</p>
<h2 id="description-of-learning-outcomes" class="anchor">Description of learning outcomes </h2>

<p>The power of the scientific method lies in identifying a given problem
as a special case of an abstract class of problems, identifying
general solution methods for this class of problems, and applying a
general method to the specific problem (applying means, in the case of
computing, calculations by pen and paper, symbolic computing, or
numerical computing by ready-made and/or self-written software). This
generic view on problems and methods is particularly important for
understanding how to apply available, generic software to solve a
particular problem.
</p>

<p>Computing competence represents a central element
in scientific problem solving, from basic education and research to
essentially almost all advanced problems in modern
societies. Computing competence is simply central to further
progress. It enlarges the body of tools available to students and
scientists beyond classical tools and allows for a more generic
handling of problems. Focusing on algorithmic aspects results in
deeper insights about scientific problems.
</p>

<p>The learning outcomes are subdivided in three general categories, knowledge, skills and general competence.</p>
<h2 id="study-abroad-and-international-collaborators" class="anchor">Study abroad and international collaborators </h2>

<p>Students at the University of Oslo may choose to take parts of
their degrees at a university abroad.
</p>

<p>Students in this program have a number of interesting international
exchange possibilities. The involved researchers have extensive
collaborations with other researchers worldwide. These exchange
possibility range from top universities in the USA, Asia and Europe as
well as leading National Laboratories in the USA.
</p>
<h2 id="career-prospects" class="anchor">Career prospects </h2>

<p>Candidates who are capable of modeling and understanding complicated
systems in natural science, are in short supply in society.  The
computational methods and approaches to scientific problems students learn
when working on their thesis projects are very similar to the methods
they will use in later stages of their careers.  To handle large
numerical projects demands structured thinking and good analytical
skills and a thorough understanding of the problems to be solved. This
knowledge makes the students unique on the job market.
</p>

<p>Career opportunities are many, from research institutes, universities
and university colleges and a multitude of companies. Examples
include IBM, Hydro, Statoil, and Telenor.  The program gives an
excellent background for further studies.
</p>

<p>The program has also a strong international element which allows students to
gain important experience from international collaborations in
science, with the opportunity to spend parts of the time spent on
thesis work at research institutions abroad.
