Department of Physics of the University of Oslo. This program is
called <b>Computational Physics and Quantum Technologies</b>, with acronym
<b>CPQT</b>. Tentative start fall semester 2024.

<h2 id="strategic-importance" class="anchor">Strategic importance </h2>

<p>Computational physics, computational science and data science play a
central role in scientific investigations and are central to
innovation in most domains of our lives. These fields underpin the
majority of today's technological, economic and societal feats. We
have entered an era in which huge amounts of data offer enormous
opportunities, but only to those who are able to harness them. The 3rd
industrial revolution will alter significantly the demands on the
workforce. In particular, the developments taking place in quantum
technologies and quantum information systems (QIS) together with
artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) are expected to
play a significant role in technology developments and innovations,
and for fundamental discoveries in physics.
</p>
<h3 id="ai-and-machine-learning" class="anchor">AI and machine learning  </h3>

<p>Artificial
intelligence is built upon integrated machine learning algorithms,
which in turn are fundamentally rooted in optimization and statistical
learning.
</p>

<p>Artificial intelligence (AI) and Machine learning (ML)  techniques
have in the last years gained considerable traction in
scientific discovery. In particular, applications and techniques for
so-called <b>fast ML</b>, that is high-performance ML methods applied
to real time experimental data processing, hold great promise for
enhancing scientific discoveries in many different disciplines.
These developments cover a broad mix of rapidly
evolving fields, from the development of ML techniques to computer and
hardware architectures.
</p>

<p>An important and emerging field is what has been dubbed as scientific ML, see the article by Deiana et al <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.13041" target="_self">Applications and Techniques for Fast Machine Learning in Science, arXiv:2110.13041</a></p>

<p>The authors discuss applications and techniques for fast machine
learning (ML) in science &ndash; the concept of integrating power ML
methods into the real-time experimental data processing loop to
accelerate scientific discovery. The report covers three main areas
</p>

<ol>
<li> applications for fast ML across a number of scientific domains;</li>
<li> techniques for training and implementing performant and resource-efficient ML algorithms;</li>
<li> and computing architectures, platforms, and technologies for deploying these algorithms.</li>
</ol>
<p>For our research in for example particle and
nuclear physics, fields which cover a huge range of energy and length scales,
spanning from our smallest constituents to the physics of dense
astronomical objects like supernovae and neutron stars, AI and ML
techniques offer possibilities for new discoveries and deeper insights
about the physics of atomic nuclei, elementary particles and dense
matter. Similarly, ML algorithms are widely applied in condensed
matter physics, materials science and nanotechnology, in molecular dynamics simulations of complex
systems in neuroscience and in many other fields in natural science.

<h3 id="quantum-information-technologies-qit" class="anchor">Quantum Information Technologies (QIT) </h3>

<p>Recent developments in quantum information systems
and technologies offer the possibility to address some of the most
challenging large-scale problems, whether they are represented by
complicated interacting quantum mechanical systems or classical
systems.  Originally proposed by Feynman, the efficient simulation of
for example quantum systems by other, more controllable quantum
systems formed the basis for modern constructions of quantum
computations.  Many algorithmic and theoretical advances have followed
since the initial work in this area and with recent developments in
quantum computing hardware there is an additional drive to identify
early practical problems on which these devices might demonstrate an
advantage.
</p>

<p>In addition to theoretical activities conducted at the
Department of Physics (mainly at the Center for Computing in Science
Education (CCSE) and the condensed matter group and other groups), there is a growing
interest to study candidate systems for making quantum hardware. In
particular, so-called point defects in semiconductors are pursued by
experimenters at the center for Materials Science.  With this broad
list of activities at the department of physics, there is a huge
potential to prepare the ground for educating physicists with the
theoretical and experimental background needed for the 21st
century. There is also a great interest in candidates with such a
background, knowledge, skills and competences in industry and the
public sector.
</p>
<h3 id="why-such-a-program" class="anchor">Why such a program? </h3>

<p>Establishing such an educational program will be unique in Norway and
has the potential to attract excellent students.  The popularity of
the Computational Science and in particular the Computational Physics
and Computational Materials Science study direction are clear
indicattors that these are fields with the potential to attract new
students.
</p>

<p>Furthermore,
Oslo Metropolitan university  has recently acquired two quantum quantum computers, see <a href="https://kommunikasjon.ntb.no/pressemelding/oslomet-avduker-norges-forste-kvantedatamaskin?publisherId=15678779&releaseId=17917781" target="_self"><tt>https://kommunikasjon.ntb.no/pressemelding/oslomet-avduker-norges-forste-kvantedatamaskin?publisherId=15678779&releaseId=17917781</tt></a> and is now establishing research and educational initiatives in quantum information systems. There are thus several interesting avenues for joint collaborations in quantum information systems and quantum technologies as well as developing joint educational programs.
