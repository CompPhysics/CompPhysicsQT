<h2 id="bachelor-of-science-program-in-computational-physics-and-quantum-technologies">Bachelor of Science program in Computational Physics and Quantum Technologies </h2>

<p>We would like to propose a new Bachelor of Science program at the
Department of Physics of the University of Oslo. This program is
called <b>Computational Physics and Quantum Technologies</b>, with acronym
<b>CPQT</b>. Tentative start fall semester 2024.
The program will be administrated by the Department of Physics. 
</p>

<p>Possible collaborations (to be discussed) with:</p>

<ul>
<li> Department of Chemistry</li>
<li> Department of Informatics</li>
<li> Department of Mathematics</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="strategic-importance">Strategic importance </h2>

<p>Computational physics, computational science and data science play a
central role in scientific investigations and are central to
innovation in most domains of our lives. These fields underpin the
majority of today's technological, economic and societal feats. We
have entered an era in which huge amounts of data offer enormous
opportunities, but only to those who are able to harness them. The 3rd
industrial revolution will alter significantly the demands on the
workforce. In particular, the developments taking place in quantum
technologies and quantum information systems (QIS) together with
artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) are expected to
play a significant role in technology developments and innovations,
and for fundamental discoveries in physics.
</p>
<h3 id="ai-and-machine-learning">AI and machine learning  </h3>

<p>Artificial
intelligence is built upon integrated machine learning algorithms,
which in turn are fundamentally rooted in optimization and statistical
learning.
</p>

<p>Artificial intelligence (AI) and Machine learning (ML)  techniques
have in the last years gained considerable traction in
scientific discovery. In particular, applications and techniques for
so-called <b>fast ML</b>, that is high-performance ML methods applied
to real time experimental data processing, hold great promise for
enhancing scientific discoveries in many different disciplines.
These developments cover a broad mix of rapidly
evolving fields, from the development of ML techniques to computer and
hardware architectures.
</p>

<p>An important and emerging field is what has been dubbed as scientific ML, see the article by Deiana et al <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.13041" target="_blank">Applications and Techniques for Fast Machine Learning in Science, arXiv:2110.13041</a></p>

<p>The authors discuss applications and techniques for fast machine
learning (ML) in science &ndash; the concept of integrating power ML
methods into the real-time experimental data processing loop to
accelerate scientific discovery. The report covers three main areas
</p>

<ol>
<li> applications for fast ML across a number of scientific domains;</li>
<li> techniques for training and implementing performant and resource-efficient ML algorithms;</li>
<li> and computing architectures, platforms, and technologies for deploying these algorithms.</li>
</ol>
<p>For our research in for example particle and
nuclear physics, fields which cover a huge range of energy and length scales,
spanning from our smallest constituents to the physics of dense
astronomical objects like supernovae and neutron stars, AI and ML
techniques offer possibilities for new discoveries and deeper insights
about the physics of atomic nuclei, elementary particles and dense
matter. Similarly, ML algorithms are widely applied in condensed
matter physics, materials science and nanotechnology, in molecular dynamics simulations of complex
systems in neuroscience and in many other fields in natural science.

<h3 id="quantum-information-technologies-qit">Quantum Information Technologies (QIT) </h3>

<p>Recent developments in quantum information systems
and technologies offer the possibility to address some of the most
challenging large-scale problems, whether they are represented by
complicated interacting quantum mechanical systems or classical
systems.  Originally proposed by Feynman, the efficient simulation of
for example quantum systems by other, more controllable quantum
systems formed the basis for modern constructions of quantum
computations.  Many algorithmic and theoretical advances have followed
since the initial work in this area and with recent developments in
quantum computing hardware there is an additional drive to identify
early practical problems on which these devices might demonstrate an
advantage.
</p>

<p>In addition to theoretical activities conducted at the
Department of Physics (mainly at the Center for Computing in Science
Education (CCSE) and the condensed matter group and theory group), there is a growing
interest to study candidate systems for making quantum hardware. In
particular, so-called point defects in semiconductors are pursued by
experimenters at the center for Materials Science.  With this broad
list of activities at the department of physics, there is a clear
potential to prepare the ground for educating physicists with the
theoretical and experimental background needed for the 21st
century. There is also a great interest in candidates with such a
background, knowledge, skills and competences in industry and the
public sector.
</p>

<p>Establishing such a program, could also lay the foundations for theoretical and experimental activities in quantum technologies.</p>
<h3 id="why-such-a-program">Why such a program? </h3>

<p>Establishing such an educational program will be unique in Norway and
has the potential to attract excellent students.  The popularity of
the Computational Science and in particular the Computational Physics
and Computational Materials Science study direction indicates that
these are fields with the potential to attract new students.
</p>

<p>We may also consider adding a new study direction (or changing the
name of Physics and Materials Science to Computational Physics and
Quantum Technologies) for the CS master of science program.
</p>

<p>Furthermore,
Oslo Metropolitan university  has recently acquired two quantum quantum computers, see <a href="https://kommunikasjon.ntb.no/pressemelding/oslomet-avduker-norges-forste-kvantedatamaskin?publisherId=15678779&releaseId=17917781" target="_blank"><tt>https://kommunikasjon.ntb.no/pressemelding/oslomet-avduker-norges-forste-kvantedatamaskin?publisherId=15678779&releaseId=17917781</tt></a> and is now establishing research and educational initiatives in quantum information systems. There are thus several interesting avenues for joint collaborations in quantum information systems and quantum technologies as well as developing joint educational programs.
</p>
<h2 id="links-of-interest-to-other-mainly-msc-and-phd-level-programs">Links of interest to other (mainly MSc and PhD level) programs  </h2>

<p>There are many universities around the world offering quantum
computing as a graduate program, allowing a bridge to form
between research and industry. This is especially beneficial for
students looking to transition from academia into a quantum computing
job. 
<a href="https://thequantuminsider.com/2022/06/06/top-20-quantum-computing-masters-ph-d-programs-in-2022/" target="_blank"> The list here shows some of the  top 20 quantum computing graduate programs (master of science and PhD programs) in 2022</a>

<h2 id="more-on-motivation">More on motivation </h2>

<p>Computational physics plays a central role in the above mentioned
developments.  Computations are simply indispensable.  At the
department of physics of the university of Oslo this is reflected in
the extremely popular study direction Computational Physics of the
master of science (MSc) program Computational Science. This program
has over the last two decades recruited many excellent students,
resulting in highly attractive candidates in academia and in industry
and the public sector. A large fraction of these students have
specialized either in artificial intelligence and machine learning
and/or in quantum information systems.  The large majority of the
these students have job offers at least one year before completing
their MSc theses. The program has also become one of the most
selective master programs at the University of Oslo, requiring a grade
average of 4.7 for entry in 2021. Furthermore, with recent advances in
quantum technologies, there is a strong potential for new developments
in the fields of nanotechnology and materials science, with the
possibilities to develop new experimental activities.
</p>
<h2 id="rationale">Rationale  </h2>

<p>The rationale behind proposing a new bachelor of science (BSc) program in computational physics and quantum technologies (QT) is:</p>
<ol>
<li> To attract at an earlier stage new students with an explicit interest in QIS, QT and AI and ML in physics.</li> 
<li> To enhance the recruitment to fields in physics which are in high demand for students and candidates with an expertise in computations, QIS, QT, AI and ML. We expect high demands from both the private sector and the public sector for candidates with these competences, insights and skills.</li>
<li> Candidates with such a background will be of great importance for new scientific discoveries and technological innovations. At the department of physics of the university of Oslo there are several research directions whose scientific activities will benefit at large from candidates with such a background, spanning from fast ML for new discoveries to the development of QTs.</li>   
</ol>
<h2 id="structure-of-program-and-courses">Structure of Program and Courses </h2>

<p>In developing such a program the Center for Computing in Science
Education (CCSE) at the university of Oslo (UiO) could be the entity
which provides the pedagogical research resources. It has the needed
research experience on how to design curricula so that students
develop deep knowledge that is connected and useful. Together with colleagues and interested teachers from other research groups, one can establish an educational team which oversees the development of courses in these topics and lays the foundation for an innovative educational program. 
</p>

<p>The figure here, inspired by the QuSTEAM project in the USA <a href="https://qusteam.org" target="_blank"><tt>https://qusteam.org</tt></a>
shows how one can link educational developments by involving various stakeholders from academia, industry research  laboratories. 
</p>

<br/><br/>
<center>
<p><img src="qusteam.png" width="700" align="bottom"></p>
</center>
<br/><br/>

<p>To base the development of courses and educational programs on
established research in physics education has several important
aspects. In particular, quantum mechanics is a highly non-trivial
topic to teach and there are several topics which deserve the
attention of physics education research, such as
</p>

<ol>
<li> Lots of conceptual learning: superposition, entanglement, QIS and QT, etc.</li> 
<li> Connecting statistics and mathematics with ML methods</li>
<li> Linking ML algorithms with quantum ML.</li>
<li> Coding is indispensable. This is a central reason why the CCSE could (or should) be involved.</li>
<li> Machine learning and artificial intelligence in physics involve also many compiutational aspects which fit well with data analysis and statistics.</li>
<li> Experience with teamwork, project management, and communication are important and highly valued.</li>
<li> Experience with engagement with industry, public sector and priority to diversity through the Computational Science program and other activities at the CCSE.</li>
<li> Mentorship should begin the moment students enroll. The experiences with the Computational Science program developed at the CCSE will be of great value. Similalrly, the activities of the KURT center are highly relevant (with important ramifications to high school education).</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="societal-needs">Societal needs </h2>

<p>The program aims at addressing future societal needs, such as the
needs for specialized candidates (Master of Science, PhDs, postdocs),
but also the needs of people with a broad overview of what is possible
in QIS and QT. There are not enough potential employees in AI, ML, QIS
and QT. There is a clear supply gap.
</p>

<p>A BSc degree with specialization is thus a good place to
start. Linking this with the Physics MSc program and the Computational
Science program and the study directions Computational physics and
Computational materials science, will offer our various research
fields top candidates as well as pointing to new research directions.
</p>
<h2 id="study-specializations-in-the-bsc-program">Study specializations in the BSc program </h2>

<p>The program could offer  three possible directions</p>
<ol>
<li> Quantum information systems and quantum technologies</li>
<li> Artificial intelligence and machine learning in physics</li>
<li> Computational Physics</li>
</ol>
<p>The students specialize in these directions in their last year of the BSc program.</p>

<p>There are several existing courses which can be included in this
program. There are also courses which need to be established. At the
CCSE we have the research and educational expertise to establish two
to three new courses in these directions. Similarly, we expect
potential teachers from both the theory group and the condensed matter
group.
</p>

<p>Researchers at the CCSE have for more than twenty years been deeply
involved in the establishment and development of courses in
computational physics, data analysis and machine elarning
(FYS3150/4150 established in 1999 and FYS-STK3155/4155 established in
2018). Furthermore, the same group offers advanced courses in
computational physics (FYS4411/9411 and FYS4460/9460 since early 2000)
and two new courses on quantum computing and advanced data analysis
and machine learning for the physical sciences (FYS5419/FYS9419 and
FYS5429/FYS9429, start spring 2023).
